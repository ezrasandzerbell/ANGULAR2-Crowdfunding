    "description": "On Christmas night Oregon State Trooper Nic Cederberg (32) was shot multiple times at close range while engaging a murder suspect, who died during the confrontation.  Nic sustained life threatening injuries, and is currently in the intensive care unit at a Portland hospital.  He has undergone multiple lengthy surgeries and has a long road of recovery ahead of him. We are also very lucky to have him still with us. <br><br>Nics brave actions that night are no suprise to anyone that knows and loves him.  He has not the type to run from a fight and unfortunately during this fight he was hurt fairly bad.  He loves being an OSP officer and is extremely good at what he does.  He pours his heart and soul into protecting each and everyone of us, and now we are asking for you to send a little bit of that love his way.",

We will arrive in DC on January 20th to join all of our powerful, beautiful, and courageous sisters in the Women's March. There will be four of us running, but we’ll be running for all of us.<br><br>If you would like to support Planned Parenthood and our run, please donate here (we are hoping to raise $44,000 in honor of the 44th President, Barack Hussein Obama).<br><br>Please join us along the route.  We would love to run through your city with you, and will be sure to carry the baton of hope and health all the way to our nation's capitol.<br><br> I can't do much, but I CAN do this. See you in DC.",
